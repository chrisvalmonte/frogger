## About

This project demonstrates my object-oriented programming with JavaScript. It is a browser-based recreation of the classic arcade game, frogger.

## How To Play

In this game you, the Player, must reach the water, without colliding into any one of the Enemies (bugs). The player can move left, right, up and down using the arrow keys. The enemies move in varying speeds on the concrete squares of the game board. Once the player collides with an enemy, the the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water, the game is won.

## Starting The Game

To start the game, open `index.html` in your browser.

## Dependencies

* `js/engine.js`, the game engine pulled from the original project.
* `js/resources.js`, the image loading utility pulled from the original project.
